            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Dominic "Dom" Cobb is a skilled thief, the best in the dangerous art of extraction: stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him a fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now, he's being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back, but only if he can accomplish the impossible—inception, planting an idea instead of stealing one.</p>
